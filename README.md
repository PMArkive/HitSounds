# HitSounds
SourceMod plugin for playing hitsounds. **Made and tested for CS:GO only!** I have not tested other games so no comment on compatability.

*Note: Compiled in `SM 1.11.6882`*

# Features:
- Separate hitsounds for hitting body shots, head shots, and kills
- `sm_hsvol` feature to control volume of hitsounds

# Installation:
1. Download this repository as a `.zip` file by pressing the `Code` button in the top right
2. Drag and drop all the files into your CS:GO files
3. **Make sure to add the files to your server's FastDL**
4. Make sure to change map so sounds are properly cached
